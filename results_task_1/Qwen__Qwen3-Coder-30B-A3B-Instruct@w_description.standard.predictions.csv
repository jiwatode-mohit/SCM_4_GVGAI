The ASCII art shows a grid-based maze with walls, a player avatar (avatar), keys, doors, and an exit. The player can push keys to activate doors, which matches the mechanics described in brainman where keys are pushed into doors to open them and reach the exit. The layout and movement patterns align with this game's puzzle-solving nature.",,brainman,True

The ASCII art shows a grid-based environment with walls, tables, and characters (avatar, chefs, items like inc3, inc5, inc6, inc4). The presence of chefs chasing the avatar and collecting ingredients in a specific order (flour, milk, eggs, sugar, butter, cherries) strongly indicates the cake-baking mechanic of cakybaky. The layout resembles a maze-like structure with distinct rooms and pathways typical of this game's design.",,cakybaky,True

The ASCII-rendered game screens show a maze-like environment with walls, floors, and portals (entry1, entry2, exit1, exit2). The player character (avatar) moves through this maze, and the presence of portals that teleport the player between random locations is a key distinguishing feature. The layout includes multiple paths, exits, and entry/exit portal pairs, which aligns with the portal-based movement mechanics described in the ""portals"" game. Other games like boulderchase or iceandfire have different core mechanics and layouts.",,multiple,False

The ASCII art shows camel characters moving left across a track with betting spots and a goal line, which matches the race betting game mechanics where players bet on which camel will win.",,racebet,True
