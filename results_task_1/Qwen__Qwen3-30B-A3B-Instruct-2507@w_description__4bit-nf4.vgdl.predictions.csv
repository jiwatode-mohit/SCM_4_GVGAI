The repeated patterns of walls, floor tiles, and specific symbols like ""exit1"", ""exit2"", ""entry1"", ""entry2"", and ""sitting"" suggest a maze-based game with moving hazards. The avatar's movement and the presence of ""random"" and ""horizontal"" markers indicate dynamic elements like boulders, crabs, or butterflies. The consistent layout of walls and the focus on collecting diamonds while avoiding hazards align with *boulderchase*. The game's mechanics, including the need to collect items and avoid deadly boulders, are clearly reflected in the ASCII frames.",,boulderchase,False

The avatar moves through a maze of tables, avoiding a chef who chases it. The game features sequential ingredient collection (flour, milk, egg, sugar, butter, cherries) with a requirement to collect them in order.
