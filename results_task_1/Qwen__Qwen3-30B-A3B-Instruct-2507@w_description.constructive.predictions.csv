The ASCII frames show a grid with walls, a player avatar, boulders that fall when blocks beneath them are removed, and a goal. The presence of falling boulders, digging mechanics (removing blocks), enemies (implied by ""box"" and ""obstacle""), and the need to collect gems to progress aligns with the description of Boulderchase.",,boulderchase,False

The repeated use of ""wall"", ""floor"", ""avatar"", ""exit1"", ""exit2"", ""goal"", ""entry1"", ""entry2"", ""random"", ""sitting"", ""vertical"", ""horizontal"", and the presence of a moving avatar in a maze-like environment with falling boulders and dynamic block removal strongly matches the gameplay of Boulderchase, where the player digs through terrain, collects gems, and avoids falling boulders while enemies move independently.",,boulderchase,False

The ASCII frames show camels moving toward a goal, with walls and a structured arena layout. The camels are consistently represented as pairs (e.g., camelA camelA), indicating they move together, which aligns with the betting mechanic in racebet where camels race in parallel. The repeated pattern of camels advancing step by step, followed by one camel reaching the goal and triggering a win, matches the race progression in racebet.",,racebet,True

The repeated patterns of boulders, dirt, and the player character (avatar) navigating through a cave-like grid with falling boulders, along with the presence of a sword and exit door, align with the mechanics of Boulderchase. The consistent layout, falling boulders, and the player's need to avoid hazards while collecting gems and reaching the exit confirm this.",,boulderchase,True

The game features a maze with keys, doors, and an avatar moving through a grid. Keys move in straight lines when pushed and destroy doors upon contact. The avatar can push keys, and the goal is to open all doors to reach the exit. The layout and mechanics match Brainman exactly.",,brainman,True

The recurring elements such as aliens moving leftward, bombs dropped by enemies, supply crates replenishing ammunition, a city at the bottom that must be protected, and the player's avatar navigating to shoot enemies and prevent them from reaching the city are all hallmarks of Defender. The consistent layout with a central path, enemies descending from the right, and the presence of supply crates and bombs aligns precisely with Defender's gameplay mechanics.",,defender,True

The repeated patterns of walls, floors, exits, entries, and a moving avatar, along with the presence of ""sitting"" and ""random"" markers, suggest a cave exploration game with falling boulders. The layout and consistent use of directional indicators (horizontal, vertical, random) match the mechanics of Boulderchase, where players dig through caves, avoid falling boulders, and navigate around enemies.
