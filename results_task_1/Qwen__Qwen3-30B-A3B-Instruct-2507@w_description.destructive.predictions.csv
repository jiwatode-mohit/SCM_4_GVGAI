The recurring patterns of walls, tables, avatars, chefs, and numbered inc markers (inc3, inc4, inc5, inc6) suggest a structured, grid-based environment with movable elements and a central character (avatar). The consistent layout with teleportation-like transitions (e.g., avatar moving across the grid) and the presence of multiple identical layouts across frames indicate a puzzle game involving spatial manipulation. The mechanics align with portals: the avatar moves through a grid-based world, and the only logical explanation for the avatar’s movement across the screen while maintaining consistent surroundings is portal-based traversal.
