The ASCII art shows a side-scrolling shooter game with a player-controlled spaceship (avatar) at the bottom, defending against waves of alien spacecraft approaching from above. The layout features a consistent horizontal structure with walls, supply items, bombs, and alien enemies moving in formation - typical of Defender's gameplay mechanics. The presence of ""portalAmmo"" and ""supply"" items, along with the clear distinction between player ship and enemy aliens, confirms this is Defender.",,defender,True

The ASCII art shows a character (avatar) navigating through a level with walls, gems, gold items, and monsters, with boulders and obstacles that need to be avoided or manipulated. The layout and movement mechanics match Boulder Chase, where players control a character to reach an exit while avoiding or pushing boulders.",,boulderchase,False

The ASCII renders show a character (avatar) navigating through a maze-like environment with walls, floors, and moving boulders. The presence of boulders that can be pushed to create platforms or block paths, along with the need to reach an exit portal while avoiding obstacles, are key indicators of the boulderchase gameplay mechanics. The consistent pattern of boulder movement and the strategic element of manipulating them to progress through levels matches this game perfectly.",,boulderchase,False

The ASCII art shows a character (camelA, camelB, etc.) navigating through a level with moving boulders and pits, trying to reach a goal or exit. This matches the core mechanics of Boulderchase, where players must navigate through levels filled with moving boulders while avoiding obstacles and deadly boulders to reach the exit portal. The repeated pattern of characters moving left and the presence of pits and arena areas further confirms this.",,boulderchase,False
