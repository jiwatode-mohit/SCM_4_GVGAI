Walls and doors block movement; doors require a key missile to open. The player loses if the avatar is destroyed (e.g., by wall or boulder), or if the exit is destroyed. The game ends when the exit is destroyed (lose) or the avatar is removed (win), with victory achieved by reaching the exit after collecting all required keys and gems.",

Aliens spawn periodically from invisible portals (slow or fast variants) and drop red bombs. The avatar can collect ammo supplies to replenish bullets. Cities are destroyed by bombs or alien collisions, reducing the score. The player wins by surviving 1000 steps or losing if the avatar or all cities are destroyed. Missiles and aliens are destroyed on collision; supplies are blocked by walls and cities.",

The goal is to guide lasers to destroy obstacles and reach the goal. The avatar can bounce off boxes and mirrors, while boulders are pushed and can rotate cannons and mirrors. Lasers kill the avatar if hit directly, but the avatar is safe if hit from behind. The player wins by destroying all goals. The game ends if the avatar is killed or all goals are cleared.",

Boulders move slowly and push back when blocked. Crabs and butterflies chase the player and kill them on contact. Collecting diamonds increases score by 2. If a boulder hits the player from above, the player dies. Crabs can transform into diamonds on dirt; butterflies can do the same but grant +1 score. The player wins by reaching the exit door only after collecting at least 9 diamonds. Losing occurs by dying or failing to collect enough diamonds.",
