The ASCII-rendered game screens show a maze-like environment with walls, a player avatar (avatar), keys (key), green and blue items (green, blue), and a door (door). These elements match the description of BrainMan where the player navigates a maze collecting gems and using keys as missiles to destroy doors. The consistent layout and item placements across frames indicate a maze navigation game with collectible items and destructible barriers, typical of brainman.",,brainman,True

The ASCII art shows a grid-based environment with walls, tables (likely obstacles/collectibles), and a chef character. The player avatar moves through this space, and there are incremental indicators (inc3, inc5, etc.) suggesting a sequence of collection. The presence of a chef chasing the player and the requirement to collect items in order strongly indicates ""cakybaky"", where players must gather ingredients sequentially while avoiding a pursuing chef.",,cakybaky,True

The ASCII render shows a maze-like environment with walls, gems, gold, and monsters, which matches the DigDug gameplay where the player navigates to collect gems and eliminate monsters.

The ASCII-rendered game screens show a maze-like environment with walls, floors, and portals. The player avatar (represented by ""avatar"") navigates through the level, encountering entry/exit points and goal sprites. The consistent presence of portals that transport the avatar between matching colored points, along with the objective to reach green goal sprites while avoiding red bullets, strongly indicates the game is ""portals"". The layout and movement patterns align perfectly with the described mechanics of portal-based navigation and enemy avoidance.",,portals,True

The ASCII art shows a track with four camels (A-D) racing towards a goal, pits (pitA-pitD) where players can bet, and a clear goal area. The visual pattern matches the described RaceBet gameplay where players bet on camels and aim to have two winning bets when any winner reaches the goal.",,racebet,True
