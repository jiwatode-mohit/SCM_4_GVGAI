The presence of ""random"" floors and ""horizontal"" or ""vertical"" indicators implies moving or changing terrain. The avatar's movement leftward across multiple frames, combined with the consistent layout and the mention of falling boulders (implied by the ""sitting"" and ""random"" floor patterns), matches the mechanics of Boulderchase, where the player digs through caves, avoids falling boulders, and collects gems while navigating a shifting environment.",,boulderchase,False

The repeated presence of ""wall"", ""gem"", ""gold"", ""monster"", and the avatar moving through a maze-like structure with dynamic elements like falling boulders (implied by shovel and monster actions) and enemies that can be killed by boulders aligns with the mechanics of Boulderchase. The use of the shovel and the pattern of boulder movement suggest digging and falling rocks, key features of Boulderchase.",,boulderchase,False

The repeated presence of boulders that fall when the player digs, the use of directional controls to move and dig, the hazard of being crushed by falling boulders, and the goal of collecting gems and reaching the exit all match the gameplay of Boulderchase. The consistent layout of walls, the appearance of ""lup"", ""ldown"", ""lcdown"" symbols indicating laser-like paths or movement, and the progression of the avatar through the maze with boulders falling behind are indicative of Boulderchase's mechanics.",,boulderchase,False

The repeated patterns of walls, floors, and the avatar moving through a maze-like structure with dynamic elements like falling boulders (implied by the presence of ""random"" and ""exit1"" in consistent positions) and the use of ""floor"" and ""wall"" as static boundaries suggest a cave exploration game with physics-based hazards. The consistent appearance of ""avatar"", ""exit1"", ""exit2"", ""entry1"", ""entry2"", and ""sitting"" indicates a level with fixed points of interest, while the movement of the avatar through these points and the presence of ""random"" suggest environmental changes. The game involves collecting items (implied by ""exit"" and ""goal"") while navigating a terrain where unsupported boulders fall—this matches the description of Boulderchase exactly.",,boulderchase,False

The repeated presence of boulders, dirt, walls, and the consistent pattern of boulders falling and crushing the player when unsupported, along with the diamond and exitdoor elements, matches the gameplay of Boulderchase. The action ""ACTION_USE"" likely corresponds to digging, and the consistent layout of the environment with falling boulders and the need to collect gems and reach the exit confirms it.",,boulderchase,True

The repeated presence of ""gem"", ""gold"", ""monster"", and ""entrance"" in the layout, along with the player avatar moving upward and the consistent pattern of walls and obstacles, matches the style of Boulderchase. The falling boulders and enemy movement are implied by the monster positions and the context of digging through caves.

The repeated patterns of falling boulders (represented by ldown, lcdown, etc.), the presence of obstacles and boxes, the avatar moving leftward through a maze-like structure, and the goal being a distant exit all point to boulderchase. The consistent use of directional indicators like ldown and lcdown suggests the movement of falling boulders, a core mechanic in boulderchase.",,boulderchase,False

The repeated patterns of walls, floors, and specific symbols like ""exit1"", ""exit2"", ""entry1"", ""entry2"", and ""avatar"" suggest a maze-like environment with movable elements. The consistent presence of ""floor"" and ""wall"" in a grid format, along with the appearance of ""sitting"" and ""vertical"" markers, indicates a dynamic environment where the player (avatar) moves through a cave. The mention of boulders falling and crushing the player, along with enemies digging and dropping gems, aligns with the gameplay of *boulderchase*, where the player must collect gems while managing falling boulders and avoiding enemies. The progression of the avatar through the maze, the use of entry/exit points, and the focus on digging and survival are all hallmarks of *boulderchase*.",,boulderchase,False
