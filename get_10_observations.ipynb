No points are given in this game. You either bet for the one that wins (and the player wins) or you don't (and the player loses).\",\n",

There are also enemies in the level that kill the player on collision with them. Also, the player can shoot boulders by pressing USE two consecutive time steps, which kill enemies.\",\n",

    "    \"brainman\": \"The player must push keys into doors to open them, to reach the exit to win the game. Many gems around are available for collection, which give score to the player. Keys are pushed by colliding with them, and they are propelled in a straight line until finding a sprite to collide against, when they stop. If they hit a door, both the door and the key are destroyed.\",\n",

The player must eliminate these enemies as soon as possible so the city is not destroyed, otherwise the player loses. The player’s ammunition is supplied from the top of the screen and must be collected periodically to avoid running out of ammo.\",\n",

    "    \"lasers2\": \"The objective of this game is to reach the exit, which is typically blocked by a mud sprite. The mud can be destroyed by directing a laser to it. There are several laser cannons whose orientation can be changed by the player shooting at them. Apart from this, there are several crystal blocks, which can also be rotated, that deflect the lasers in a certain direction. Lasers kill the player when in contact.\",\n",

As the player digs, boulders that are left without a ground fall and can kill the player upon collision. Enemies also move around the cave, being able to dig as well. When digging, they drop gems that can also be collected by the player. Enemies are also killed by boulders and kill the player upon contact.\",\n",

The maze is full of entry and exit portals, and every time the player goes through an entry portal they will be teleported to an exit portal at random. The maze is also full of enemies and missiles that kill the player on contact.\",\n",

The maze has multiple traps, two different types of surfaces (ice and fire), and two types of boots (for ice and fire) that can be collected. The special surfaces kill the player on contact, unless the appropriate boots are picked up beforehand. There are several coins scattered around the level that give the player some score.\",\n",

This order to follow is flour, milk, eggs, sugar, butter and cherries, although not all levels have all these ingredients. There are angry chefs around the level that chase the player, although they only care about their favourite ingredient, so only the ones that prefer the next ingredient to be picked up are active at each time.
